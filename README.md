# Newton-Raphson
Takes a polynomial and evaluates it, finds the derivitive, and uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the approximate roots.

## Description
The user chooses between 3 different choices.
- Choice 1 prints out the value of the user inputted polynomial at a given x value
- Choice 2 computes the derivate by using the derivate power rule
- Choice 3 uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the roots of the polynomial
